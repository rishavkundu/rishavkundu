Hi there, nice to meet you.

I'm a software engineer with a background in business, and am currently based in Connecticut. I'm interested in the Next.js ecosystem, language models and user experience.

I'm currently working at [Nous Research](https://nousresearch.com), a leader in the development of human-centric language models and simulators.

You can reach me directly on [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/riskun) or [Twitter](https://x.com/rishavvk). See you out there!

👋🏼
